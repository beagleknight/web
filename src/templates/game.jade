        h2 HINT: Hint is not Tetris
        h4 Technology: C++, OpenGL
        h4 Genres: puzzle
      p Created while I was studying computer science. It was build from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. You are a monster called Aka-kun and you need to collect a star on each level. Itâ€™s a puzzle game where you can push and rotate tetrominos on a 3D environment. We included a fancy level editor to create custom levels and a basic 2-player cooperative mode.
