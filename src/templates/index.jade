            p We wanted to create our own project so with our knowledge of web development and Facebook applications plus our restlessness in game development we founded a second company called Adverway. It was a good opportunity to mix web and games so I created my own HTML5 engine called Ethon.
            p Adverway was a platform for brands where they could create their own games for Facebook, web and mobile. We had a catalogue of game mechanics and our customer could choose one and customize it. I created some casual games for it like Memory, Jewels or Sneaky Words.

            p While I was working on my company i++ I wanted to improve my knowledge about game development. I had not enough time to start a in-person course so I decided to study an online post-graduate at UOC. I learned a lot of things about 2D and 3D game development using C++ and a custom engine provided

            p After finishing my University Degree I started a small company called imesmes (i plus plus in catalan) with some of my colleagues. We started doing small jobs like customizing wordpress templates and small static web pages.Then we created our first Facebook applications and small games on it. For a internal christmas campaign we build the game “Que venen els reis mags” in HTML5.

            p Since I was a little boy I wanted to make video games. After finishing the General Certificate of Education I started Computer Science at UAB because I thought it was the best starting point for me.
            I studied a lot of things there: lots of math, electronics, networks, how a cpu works, etc. But in those 5 years my only contact with video games was a computer graphics subject where I collaborate in the HINT project.
